üöÄ Diving Deep into HR Analytics: Key Insights Uncovered! üìä
In the ever-evolving landscape of talent management, understanding the intricacies behind employee attrition is essential. I recently analyzed our comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard, and the insights it revealed are both enlightening and actionable.

üîç Dashboard Overview:
Total Employees: 1,470
Total Attrition: 237
Attrition Rate: 16.1%
Average Age of Employees: 37 years
Average Salary: $6.5K
Average Experience: 7 years

Key Insights:
1. Attrition by Education:
Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) professionals are the most affected, suggesting a need to reassess the work environment and career progression opportunities in these fields.
Technical Degrees (14%) and Marketing (15%) also show notable attrition, indicating potential gaps in alignment with job roles or career growth.

2. Attrition by Age:
The 26-35 age group is experiencing the highest attrition with 116 employees leaving. A search for better opportunities or dissatisfaction with current roles could drive this.
The 18-25 (44) and 36-45 (43) age brackets also show significant attrition, while the 46-55 (26) and 55+ (8) groups are comparatively more stable.

3. Attrition by Salary Slab:
A staggering 163 employees earning up to 5k have left, highlighting a potential issue with salary satisfaction.
As salary increases, attrition decreases, with 49 employees in the 5k-10k range, 20 in the 10k-15k range, and only 5 in the 15k+ range leaving. This indicates that competitive compensation is a key retention factor.

4. Attrition by Years at Company:
Attrition spikes at 1 year (59 employees), suggesting challenges with early-stage employee engagement.
Interestingly, another spike at 10 years (18 employees) could point to mid-career reassessment or a desire for change after a decade.

5. Job Satisfaction:
Laboratory Technicians (62 attritions) and Sales Executives (57 attritions) are particularly concerning, especially when satisfaction scores vary widely across roles.
Despite high job satisfaction in some areas, attrition remains an issue, emphasizing the complexity of employee retention beyond just satisfaction.

6. Gender Dynamics:
Male employees (140) leave more than female employees (79), which may indicate a need to examine gender-specific factors influencing attrition.


As we continue to investigate these insights, it‚Äôs clear that a targeted approach is essential for retaining our best talent. By addressing the root causes of attrition through improved career development opportunities, competitive compensation, or enhanced early-stage engagement, we can strengthen our workforce and reduce turnover.

Let's continue to drive data-driven decisions that foster a positive, sustainable work environment! üíº‚ú®
